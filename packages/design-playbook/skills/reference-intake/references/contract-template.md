## manifest.json shape

Write beside this contract as `.scratch/<run>/reference/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "schema": "design-playbook.reference.manifest/v1",
  "run_id": "<run>",
  "captured_at": "2026-07-22T00:00:00+08:00",
  "tool": "reference-intake",
  "sources": [
    {
      "id": "src-1",
      "kind": "screenshot",
      "locator": "reference/assets/hero-<digest-prefix>.png",
      "sha256": "<hex or null>",
      "media_type": "image/png",
      "storage": "copied",
      "acquired_via": "attachment",
      "provider": "optional-host-tool-name",
      "captured_at": "2026-07-22T00:00:00+08:00",
      "note": "optional"
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules:

- `kind` is one of: `screenshot`, `url`, `design_file`, `product_analogy`, `other`
- copied ephemeral raster locators are run-root-relative under `reference/assets/`; existing authored fixtures may retain `assets/...` relative to the reference directory
- URL locators are absolute strings; `sha256` is null for pure URLs and product analogies
- `storage` is `copied`, `linked`, `remote`, or `symbolic`; `acquired_via` is `attachment`, `local-file`, `host-tool`, `export`, `url`, or `analogy`
- `media_type`, `provider`, and source-level `captured_at` are optional additive fields; `provider` is a non-path label and never changes core routing
- do not put host Fill paths into `sources`
